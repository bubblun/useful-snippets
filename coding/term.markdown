## Tuple vs. Array

A tuple, also called a sequence, is an ordered list of items, such as (0,1,1), which is a different tuple from (1,1,0) and (0,1).

A set is a collection of distinct items with no specified order, so {0,1} represents the same set as {1,0} and {0,1,1}.

An array is a collection of items ordered in any number of dimensions. For example, a tuple is a 1-dimensional array (it takes one index to locate an item), and a matrix is a 2-dimensional array (it takes two indices to locate an item).
